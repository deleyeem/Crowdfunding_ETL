# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project Overview:
This Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) mini project involves processing and analysing data.

## Team Members:
Owen Wang
Debbie Lim

## Languages, Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: For data manipulation and analysis

Pandas: For handling data structures

Jupyter Notebooks: Data collection and analysis

PostgreSQL: Relational database management system

PgAdmin: To load create database and run queries

Quick DBD: To create SQL Entity Relationship Diagram


## Description of Process:
### Extract
Extracted data by using Python and Pandas.
Use wildcards, sets, and escape characters in regular expressions to extract information.
Use special characters in regular expressions to extract information.
Create and use capture groups in regular expressions to extract information.

### Transform
Transform and clean data by using Python and Pandas and regular expressions.
Parse string data into a Python dictionary.
Use list comprehensions to make code more readable.

### Load
Create an entity relationship diagram from CSV files.
Import CSV files into a postgreSQL database.


## Conclusion:
We practiced Regular Expressions and Pandas to extract and transform data.
